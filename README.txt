Notes:
Python Version: 3
-In order to execute via the run.bat you must have a 32 bit version of python installed at the end of the default python path
-This program expects all files in the chosen directory to be named exactly as the TLOPO launcher creates them. If this naming scheme is not used the program will crash.

Files Needed to execute: parser.py datastorage.py windowClasses.py (optional: run.bat)

Usage:
1. Execute the python script either using the bat file or executing parser.py via command line
2. Select a directory containing log files matching the naming scheme produced by the TLOPO executable
To look at a specific log file:
	1. Select a log file from the left listbox
	2. Choose a tab associated with a single log file (Log Summary, Launch Info, Log Contents, Log Stats)
To look at information based on all log files located in the chosen directory:
	1. Select the Global Stats tab
	Note: This tab only changed when a new directory with different log files is chosen.
